# Baked Prompts

This directory contains pre-optimized, few-shot prompts generated by the `scripts/optimize_prompts.py` pipeline.
These prompts are loaded at runtime to ensure the highest quality extraction and analysis without the overhead of runtime optimization.

## Files

## How to update
Run the optimization script:
```bash
uv run --project JobScraper JobScraper/scripts/optimize_prompts.py
