We have 1 island.\n- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.\n- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.\n- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.",

Initially, all the cells ofgridare water cells (i.e., all the cells are0's).\n\nWe may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an arraypositionswherepositions[i] = [ri, ci]is the position(ri, ci)at which we should operate theithoperation.\n\nReturnan array of integersanswerwhereanswer[i]is the number of islands after turning the cell(ri, ci)into a land.\n\nAnislandis surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.\n\n",
