For example, the first node withval == 1, the second node withval == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\n\nAn adjacency listis a collection of unorderedlistsused to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n\nThe given node will always be the first node withval = 1. You must return thecopy of the given nodeas a reference to the cloned graph.\n\n",
