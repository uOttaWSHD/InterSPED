      "Input:start = 1, finish = 6000, limit = 4, s = \"124\"Output:5Explanation:The powerful integers in the range [1..6000] are 124, 1124, 2124, 3124, and, 4124. All these integers have each digit <= 4, and \"124\" as a suffix. Note that 5124 is not a powerful integer because the first digit is 5 which is greater than 4.\nIt can be shown that there are only 5 powerful integers in this range.",
      "Input:start = 15, finish = 215, limit = 6, s = \"10\"Output:2Explanation:The powerful integers in the range [15..215] are 110 and 210. All these integers have each digit <= 6, and \"10\" as a suffix.\nIt can be shown that there are only 2 powerful integers in this range.",
      "Input:start = 1000, finish = 2000, limit = 4, s = \"3000\"Output:0Explanation:All integers in the range [1000..2000] are smaller than 3000, hence \"3000\" cannot be a suffix of any integer in this range."
