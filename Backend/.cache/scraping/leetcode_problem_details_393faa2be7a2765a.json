      "Input:nums = [1,2,3,4,5]Output:6Explanation:We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 3 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [3,3,3,3,3] using 4 special moves is given by |1 - 3| + |2 - 3| + |4 - 3| + |5 - 3| = 6.\nIt can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 3 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.",

The cost of changing the array to [11,11,11,11,11] using 5 special moves is given by |10 - 11| + |12 - 11| + |13 - 11| + |14 - 11| + |15 - 11| = 11.\nIt can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 11 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.",
      "Input:nums = [22,33,22,33,22]Output:22Explanation:We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 22 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [22,22,22,22,22] using 2 special moves is given by |33 - 22| + |33 - 22| = 22.\nIt can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 22 cannot be achieved at a lower cost."
